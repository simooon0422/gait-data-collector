# Walk Data Collector
Part of the "Dynamometric mat for gait rehabilitation" project. Code in this repository is meant to run on STM32 NUCLEO-L476RG and it is responsible for collecting data about the pressure from the sensors in the mat and sending it to the computer. 

This project is part of my Master's thesis and it is still in development.
